One, which is used with liquids heavier than water,sinks to 0\u00ba in pure water, and to 15\u00ba in a 15 per cent salt solution;the other, for liquids lighter than water, sinks to 0\u00ba in a 10 percent salt solution and to 10\u00ba in pure water. In both cases thegraduation, based on the distance between these fundamental points,is continued along the stem as far as desired. Since all the degreeson a Baum\u00e9 scale are thus equal in length, while those on a specific-gravity scale grow smaller as the density increases, there is nosimple relation between degrees B\u00e9. and Sp. gr. However, readings onBaum\u00e9s scale may be approximately reduced to specific gravities bythe following formul\u00e6 (x in each case being the reading on Baum\u00e9'sscale) : (a) for liquids heavier than water, sp. gr. = 144 \u00f7 (144 -x);(b) for liquids lighter than water, sp. gr. = 144 \u00f7 (134 + x)."
